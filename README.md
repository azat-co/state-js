# ES2015 (a.k.a. ES6) - only important

* Fat arrow functions
* Promises
* Object literals
* Classes
* Modules (import)

---

# ES2016 and ES2017 (ES7 and ES8) - only important

* Async await functions
* Trailing commas in functions

---

# Learn ECMAScript more in depth

# Presets? Compatibility?

<https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/>

Include specific features ‚úÖ by targets with `@babel/preset-env`:

```bash
npm install @babel/preset-env --save-exact
```

```json
{
  "presets": ["env"]
}
```

## JS Flavors

* CoffeScript v2
* TypeScript
* Elm
* ClojureScript

---

## State Management

* Redux
* Mobx
* Relay

---

## CSS

* SASS/SCSS
* LESS

* Ember
* Backbone

---

## Angular vs. React

---

## React vs. pReact

---

# Webpack and Hot Module Reloading

^not live reloading

---

# Enterprise app + Strong Typing = ‚ô•Ô∏è

Benefits:

* Static analysis, a.k.a. type checking (IDEs and build tools)
* Better, safer code reuse

---

# Which to use

## Flow has less intrusive syntax and easier to integrate while TypeScript is more mature and robust

Get started:

* For Angular, use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
* For React, use [Flow](https://flow.org)

---

# Stop using Notepad ++

Seriously! üòè

![inline 70%](images/notepadpp.png)

---

## Get VS Code

<https://code.visualstudio.com>

* Smart autocomplete
* Debugger
* Git
* Terminal
* Quick, extendable and customizable

---

## Node

* `util.promisify`
* Chakra instead of Chrome V8
* http2
* v8 + npm v5
*  Large mainstream and enterprise adoption

---

[.autoscale:true]

## How Organizations use Node

* Back-end 73%

## Roadmap to becoming a React developer in 2018

<https://github.com/adam-golab/react-developer-roadmap>

---

![inline](images/world-on-node.png)

---

## Increasing automation of jobs

* Commodity programmers and consumers of frameworks and services
* Top-notch experts and authors of frameworks and services

<https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#technology-a>

---

## AVOID being replaced by automation!

* Continue learning
* Niche out and focus (80/20)
* Be financially wise (don't depends just on one salary)

---

# Summary

* Learn ES.Next
* Use Webpack and Hot Module Reloading
* Add Flow, Redux, React Router to React if needed
* Consider Vue instead of Angular
* Use Node 10 or at least Node 8, it's faster (and Node 10 has worker threads)
* Switch to VS Code
* Adopt async functions or just use callbacks


---

# Summary CONT.

* JavaScript was a toy language
* It spread to other platforms
* It conquered web, i.e., all software
* It's used by startups and enterprises
* It's becoming feature-rich

---

## The future is bright

If can be written in JavaScript, it will be written in JavaScript. If you can pick only one language, with JS you can do so much more:

* Mixed Reality (VR and AR)
* Blockchain and dapps
* Mobile and desktop
* IoT
* Cloud and databases
